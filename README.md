<img src="FourSpacesFinder-Web/public/asset/img/readme/coverPage.png" alt="Cover Page" width="900">

A comprehensive Linear Algebra tool designed to calculate and visualize the four fundamental subspaces of a matrix: Column Space, Row Space, Null Space, and Left Null Space. This application provides step-by-step Row Reduced Echelon Form (RREF) calculations, LaTeX support for equations, and interactive 2D/3D geometric visualizations.

## Features

- **Matrix Calculation**: Support for matrices up to 5x5 with fraction arithmetic.
- **Step-by-Step RREF**: Detailed view of the Gaussian elimination process.
- **Fundamental Spaces**: Derivation and basis vectors for $C(A)$, $R(A)$, $N(A)$, and $N(A^T)$.
- **Geometric Visualization**: Interactive 3D and 2D plotting of subspaces.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available as a Native macOS application and a responsive Web application.
